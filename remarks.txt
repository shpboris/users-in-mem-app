1.
The application is based on Spring Boot and allows to manage users (CRUD operations) through Swagger UI.
Two identical Kubernetes Microservices are created and exposed using Istio.
The services differ only with their URLs.

2.
To access the local Swagger UI use this URL - http://localhost:8000/env1/swagger-ui.html

In Kubernetes environment something like below should be used to access any of the two services

2.1
Minikube
http://192.168.99.100:31308/env1/swagger-ui.html
http://192.168.99.100:31308/env2/swagger-ui.html

2.2
Docker desktop
http://localhost:80/env1/swagger-ui.html
http://localhost:80/env2/swagger-ui.html

3.
All the Kubernetes deployment folder
Dockerfile and Tiltfile directly under the users-in-mem-app

4.
The context path is controlled through CONTEXT_PATH environment varibale.
See application.properties file and
users-in-mem-app\.idea\runConfigurations\UsersApplication.xml

5.
To expose the application using plain docker on port 8888, run the following:
sudo docker run -d --name users-in-mem-app-docker -e CONTEXT_PATH=env1 -p 8888:8000 shpboris/usersmemrestserver

6.
To deploy the users REST application to Kubernetes, execute the following
using files from users-in-mem-app/deployment/ folder of this project:

6.0 kubectl apply -f namespace.yml
6.1 kubectl apply -f deployment-env1.yml
6.2 kubectl apply -f deployment-env2.yml
6.3 kubectl apply -f virtual-service.yml
6.4 kubectl apply -f gateway.yml

Alternatively, if Tilt is installed, all that is needed for full flow (!) of
compiling, creating docker image and deploying to kubernetes is just executing the following from users-in-mem-app:
tilt up
